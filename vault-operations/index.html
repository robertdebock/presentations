## Installing

Vault is a single binary in a couple of version.

- Open Source
- Enterprise
- Enterprise + HSM
- Enterprise FIPS
- Enterprise FIPS + HSM
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installing

There are binaries available for many platforms:

- Darwin
- FreeBSD
- Linux
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- Solaris
- Windows

Supported architectures: `arm`, `arm64`, `386` and `amd64` .
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installing

When using a binary, there are a few thinks that need to be done to a system:

- Create directories
- Create a configuration
- Create a group
- Create a user
- Create a startup method (SystemV or systemd)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installing

Rather than a binary, a package can also be installed:

- Debian-like: https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com
- RedHat-like: https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com

More [detail](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updating

Every 2 weeks a new version is [released](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/).

Some updates contain security fixes and may require a quick installation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updating

Simply replace the binary or package. To prevent unnecessary outages, use this order:

1. Followers of replication secondary/secondaries.
2. Leader of the replication secondary/secondaries.
3. Followers of the replication primary/primaries.
4. Leader of the replication primary/primaries.

> <aside class="notes"><p>You can technically update in any order, but may experience minor outages when a new leader is elected.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updating

As updating is required somewhat frequently, is specific and critical; automating this using for example Ansible will prove valuable.

> <aside class="notes"><p>Please have a non-production environment prepared to exercise the update.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Clustering (HA)

You can create a cluster of Vault instances, which can offer redundancy.

> <aside class="notes"><p>Vault write actions will always be handled by the leader, to performance is not typically improved by more than one machine.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Clustering (HA)

You can manually create a cluster:

```shell
vault operator raft join http://127.0.0.2:8200
```

> <aside class="notes"><p>Automatic joining is preferred to reduce administrative burden.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Clustering (HA)

Interesting to know:

1. When a Vault instance joins a cluster, a "bootstrap" sequence is started. This happens on port `:tcp/8200` (by default)
2. Cluster communication will happen on port `:tcp:8201` (by default).
3. Both ports should be available to all members of a cluster.
4. Port `:tcp/8200` uses `HTTPS`. The nodes should trust each others certificates. This is typically done by haveing a single certificate for all nodes, having either a wildcard (`*.examples.com`) or a specific Subject Alternate Name ("SAN"). For "SAN", node names need to be known.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Clustering (HA)

Automatic joining is preferred over manual joining. It allows instance replacements to occur without human intervention.

```hcl
  storage "raft" {
  path    = "/vault/vault"
  node_id = "vault_x"
  retry_join {
    auto_join = "provider=aws addr_type=public_v4 tag_key=auto_join tag_value=my_raft_instances region=us-east-1"
    auto_join_scheme = "http"
  }
}
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Clustering (HA)

Automatically joining uses [`go discovery`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover), which has many "providers", including:

- AWS
- Azure
- vSphere

> <aside class="notes"><p>&quot;auto join&quot; and &quot;auto unseal&quot; are often confused. They are different concepts.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scaling

Vault can be scaled. This is done for availability, not for performance.

A Vault cluster needs an odd number of instances, either `3` and `5`. (`5` is recommended, but `3` can be used when no more than `3` "zones" or "lanes" are available.)

You can scale both up and down, from `3` to `5` and back from `5` to `3`.

> <aside class="notes"><p>Scaling down required auto-pilot to be configured to cleanup <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot#dead-server-cleanup">&quot;dead servers&quot;</a>. If this configuration is skipped, quorum may be lost.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scaling

HashiCorp advices this [sizing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/day-one-raft/raft-reference-architecture#hardware-sizing-for-vault-servers) for individual Vault nodes:

| Size  | CPU | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) Disk IO (IOPS) | Disk thoughput (MB/s) |
| ----- | --- | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| small | 2-4 | 8-16        | 100+                     | 75+                   |
| large | 4-8 | 32-64       | 200+                     | 250+                  |

What `small` and `large` is, is not very explicit.

> <aside class="notes"><p>Smaller instances can certainly work, but if a Vault instance runs out of memory, the Vault cluster may become unstable. This situation can be difficult to fix.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Initializing

Any Vault node or cluster needs to be initialized. Initializing created an encrypted storage backend and returns the "unseal keys" or "recovery keys" and root-token. (for automatically unsealed instances) **ONCE**.

Unseal/recovery keys can be PGP can be used to prevent plain-text (shared) keys to be displayed.

It's adviced to carefully run this procedure. Although it's done once.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Initializing

The "root-token" or "root-key" is the initial key that allows all actions on Vault.

This token should be revoked as early as possible, after personal users have "high privileged" access to Vault.

> <aside class="notes"><p>Most Vault installations have the root-token <strong>NOT</strong> revoked, which is a serurity issue.</p>
</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unsealing

Every time Vault starts, it needs to be unseal. These are typical situations when unsealing is required:

- Reboot
- Restart
- Crash and start
- Stop, update, start
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unsealing

Manual unsealing requires unsealing as many times as the amount of `key-threshold` set when initializing Vault. The default value for `key-threshold` is `3` out of the `5` `key-shares`.

This means at least 3 people need to enter an unseal key on **each Vault instance**. A typical installation of Vault has  10 to 20 nodes. That would mean 30 to 60 unseal commands.

As you understand, manaul unsealing is not preferred.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unsealing

You can have Vault unseal automatically in a few way.

- AWS KMS
- Azure Key Vault
- GCP Cloud KMS
- HSM
- Transit
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unsealing

AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault and GCP Cloud KMS use a key on a cloud provider to unseal. Access to such a key becomes critical for availability and sensitive.

You can unseal a non-cloud Vault instance using cloud keys.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unsealing

An HSM can be used to unseal Vault. This does introduce a dependency on an HSM, but greatly reduces the administrative work required for unsealing.

`Transit` can also be used to unseal Vault. This mechanism unseals Vault using another Vault. This means there is a dependency on that other Vault and the initial Vault needs to be unsealed as well, likely manual.
