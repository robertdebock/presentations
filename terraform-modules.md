## What

Terraform:

- "Think yourself"
- "Consume something".

---

## Benefits "Think"

- You'll learn a lot.
- You'll understand what you're doing.
- You'll be able to fix things.
- You'll be able to extend things.

----

## Drawbacks "Think"

- Can be difficult/time consuming.
- Many edge-cases.

---

## Benefits "Consume"

- Just use something.
- No need to understand everything.

----

## Drawbacks "Consume"

- You many want something a little different.
- Maybe your general approach differs.
