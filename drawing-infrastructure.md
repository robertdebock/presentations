| Component      | Material            |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Background     | Paper or whiteboard |
| Components     | Post-IT &copy;      |
| Lines and text | Marker              |
| Shadow         | Grey marker         |

There is a philosofy for these choises:

- Paper or whiteboard: easy to replace or wipe.
- Post-IT &copy;: easy to move or replace.
